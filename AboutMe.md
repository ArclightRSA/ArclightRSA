- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ArclightRSA

I am someone that takes my coding personal, I feel that every opportunity I have to code should be my best, and should be a true reflection of myself.
That is why when I code, I want to leave my mark, a mark I could truly be proud of and that if people ever have to look back, they will be proud and appreciative of the work, that I have done.
Coming from a sports background I love taking on challenges and resolve problems in an effective and timely matter. I like adapting to new environments and do research on new methods and solutions to improve a system if needed.
